                    <p>Hi! I'm Anna :) <br><br>

                         I acknowledge that my undergraduate coursework and research was completed on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnawbe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. The land I used for my academic work  was stolen, and  there is lots of work to do to bring back the rights that indigenous and Native people deserve. Equally my internships were on land stolen from the Ohlone peoples, the Coastal Miwok, Multnomah, Wasco, Cowlitz, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Bands of Chinook, Tualatin, Kalapuya, Molalla, Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples. 

                        <br> <br>
                        In my spare time, I practice Natural Horsemanship (horse-whispering, basically) with my horse Icy. My cat, Lemon, is less on board with that sort of thing, so I mostly just feed him treats.
