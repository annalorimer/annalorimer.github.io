                    <h1 class="pad-bottom">How did I get started in Software Engineering?</h1> 
                    <p>Early on I figured out that if I treated whatever I was doing as an experiment, I got
                        support at home and left alone enough to test stuff out and try a lot of new
                        things. This led to some really weird food combinations and strange things that
                        I made out of paper and whatever else I could find. I pretty much l iked to mess
                        around with anything I could get my hands on.  This included the top-notch (at
                        the time) Dell PC my parents bought when I was 9. So like in many families I
                        became the go-to person for all things to do with the computer, especially since
                        I was the only kid. One summer I did attend an HTML/CSS coding camp for girls at
                        the local university and I enjoyed it and working with the other girls, but
                        there weren’t really other opportunities around then to follow up afterwards. So
                        I did lots of other things. Writing (in English & French), storyboards, film
                        making, baking and training horses.  What I really enjoyed about all these
                        things were the different ways of thinking and problem solving that were
                        involved with these activities. In the case of the large animals (horses) I had
                        to give quite a bit of thought to thinking about things from their perspective,
                        not just my own. I didn’t think of of this as “pre-engineering or CS” but the
                        components and passion for problem solving were there in these activities.
                        Teaching a 1500-pound horse to stand on a pedestal like a circus elephant takes
                        a surprising amount of problem solving and critical thinking skills, not to
                        mention perseverance. </p>

                        <p>Although my high school had computer science classes, it
                        was all pretty low key and there were no girls involved, just boys who had known
                        each other forever. My school was not a techie hub. Math, though, that is my
                        thing. Thankfully, my love of math didn’t get squashed and I ended up in an
                        undergraduate math program at the University of Waterloo determined to get into
                        Combinatorics and Optimization to study cryptography. Since the computer science
                        department is within the Math Faculty at Waterloo, all first year students are
                        required to complete two computer science courses. Not going to lie, those
                        courses were tough and I’m not certain that I would have continued in computer
                        science if I hadn’t had a wonderfully supportive group of friends (both in CS
                        and outside). Although I originally thought I would prefer to work on my own, I
                        found I really thrived on the cooperative projects we did for class. Once I had
                        completed those required courses, I knew I wanted to do more.  Computer science
                        provides me with that spectacular combination of theory and application. When I
                        found out that I could combine my love of math and computer science, I was
                        ecstatic. So here I am! I just started my second term of second year and I have
                        never been more excited and motivated.</p>
